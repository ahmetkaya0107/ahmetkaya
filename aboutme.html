<p>&nbsp;<strong>About Me</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />My journey started with Physics, fields very much intertwined with Mathematics, Statistics and Machine Learning. I am currently a Data and STEM Coordinator at the Coral Academy of Science Reno, NV. I have more than 10 years of data/research analysis experiences.<br /><br />At this juncture in my career in Data Science, I feel like having come across an old friend, however now endowed with so many powerful tools and resources. Libraries developed around the R-Studio are amazing. The Python Scikit-Learn package is quite comprehensive. I really enjoy programming in Python which to me is reminiscent of Matlab (and it's free!). What I really hooked up with is the Ipython (now called Jupyter) notebook. Being able to write notes, produce some code and see the results right beneath in a report format lead to fun AND structured learning. There are so many resources out there for anybody to pick up the necessary skills to be a good data scientist.<br /><br />I am truly impressed with the ecosystem built around this new exciting field. I think the power of the available material and tools is what enabled me to wade into its deep waters in such a short time. There is so much to learn, but the journey is good.<br /><br />Before diving into "learning" with the "machine" word in front, I have spent the past year trying to build a language learning system in the form of a startup. To me, the process of learning is just fascinating. Teaching what you have learned in fascination is itself fascinating. Things did not work out as I had planned, but I have learned a lot along the way. The journey goes on.<br /><br />I intend to post self-assigned projects on this website using, of course, the Jupyter notebook format. Thanks to GitHub and to the wonderful python tool, Pelican, I am able to post my notebooks as web pages. If you want to be part of this journey, follow along!</p>
